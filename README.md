# Side Theme Project for FS Team 3

The scss files are the ones where you will be assigned to work and modify.

-   Dark-theme group will work in scss/dark-theme folder

-   Light-theme group will work in scss/light-theme folder

-   Toggle button group will work in common/head_tag.html to add a toogle button in the header

-   Comment and/or uncomment "@imports..." in commmon/common.scss according to the team you are

We will asign each participant to one file, therefore we will decrease
probabilities of conflict.

Each file is assigned to modify a different component of the themes.
